# x-cell: Reactive JavaScript in HTML

Everyone puts complex CSS and HTML in JavaScript these days.

`x-cell` lets you put some simple JavaScript in your HTML!

This is _probably_ a joke.

## Running

To run locally, you'll need nodejs, (ideally [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))

Run `s/server` to start vite locally; a browser window should open.

## Building

Run `s/build` to build the code using vite. It's a bit weird how it builds things; may make better eventually.

## Documentation

TBD, check the code
